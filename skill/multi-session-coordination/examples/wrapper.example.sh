# Example cron wrapper showing coord_guard.sh as step 0.
#
# Pattern: your scheduler runs THIS wrapper; the wrapper consults the
# coordination board before doing any real work. If an interactive session
# holds what this job touches, the job defers (rc 75 from the guard) and
# simply exits 0 — silent skip; the job fires again on its own schedule.
#
# The guard is FAIL-OPEN: if the board/CLI is missing or broken, the job
# proceeds unguarded. Coordination protects work; it never blocks a backup.
